# Servantex implementation for ESP8266 (NodeMCU)

**NOTE: This project is deprecated. Please do not use it.**


Servantex is a home automation integration platform.

Note: __THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS PROJECT__

Currently servantex can help you to:

 - Connect your own lights to google assistant without buying new and expensive lights.
 - Connect your outlets to google assistant without replacing them.
 - Connect almost anything which supports On/Off states.
 
And the cool part is that you will be able to do that without writng a single line of code :)

## Hardware Requirements
 - A NodeMCU (or any other ESP8266 based board)
 - Relay modules (If you want to use On/Off states)
 
Note the each NodeMCU module is capable of controlling 17 outputs OR 8 input/outputs


## Installation (Hosted-service)

 - Create an account in Servantex website.
 - Create a new thing controller in your dashboard.
